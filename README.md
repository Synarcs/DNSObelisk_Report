## DNSObelisk: Kernel Enforced Endpoint Security for Distributed Environments 
### WhitePaper

* This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the complete Security framework to disrupt advanced DNS C2 attacks and APT implants.
* This research and implementation is neither sponsored from Univeristy of Washington nor affiliated to any university graduate research group.
* This implementation and architecture is completely done by me as an independent research student from University of Washington.
* The core framework codebase is licensed under AGPLv3, although the framework is open for collaboration and enhancements the corresponding architecture, algorithms, and core implementations explained in the report are subject to copyright under the ownership of the original author.
* The wider goal of the framework from kernel to userspace is to make DNS a safe protocol, moving DNS security inside Linux kernel to safeguard massive data planes and production data planes from these evolving DNS attack vectors.
